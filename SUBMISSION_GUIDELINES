Fork this repository and hack away!  When you are ready for a review, log into
the RMU web app and request a review for the appropriate exercise(*).

Do not share your solution or the problem description with anyone else without
talking to me about it first.  Likewise, your submission won't be shared with
anyone else by me unless I talk to you first.

NOTE: No work done after 10/25 will be evaluated, be sure to request a review
before then!

(*) As of the time of writing this feature is not in place, but will be before
10/11.  Should you wish to submit a problem for review before then, please just
email me.
